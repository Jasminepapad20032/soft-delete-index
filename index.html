        I’m treating this page like an abandoned directory page.
        The links look alive, but most of what they point to is already
        drifting, pixelated, or half missing. Soft delete: the server
        forgot to tell the memories they’re gone.

        This site is intentionally messy and incomplete. The internet
        forgets quietly; this is me trying to notice it. Each page is a
        small artefact of digital decay – an index of things half-erased,
        not quite gone, still flickering underneath the noise.
