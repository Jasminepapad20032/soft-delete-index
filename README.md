Soft Delete – Digital Decay  
https://jasminepapad20032.github.io/soft-delete-index/

1. Project Idea

My project is called Soft Delete. I wanted to explore digital decay and how online content slowly fades, breaks or becomes disconnected from its original context. Even when something is deleted, a trace usually stays somewhere. This could be a cached file, a forgotten screenshot, or a broken image that still loads halfway. I wanted the whole website to feel like wandering through pieces of the internet that should not exist anymore but still linger quietly.

Each page looks at a different kind of leftover. The index page acts like an abandoned directory. The Browser Memories page presents old tabs and half-remembered content. The Error Poems page focuses on the emotional side of system messages. The GIF Graveyard collects images that outlived the websites they were created for. Instead of telling a clear story, the project creates a space where users explore fragments.

2. Inspirations and Context

Throughout the module we talked about treating the internet as a medium rather than a tool. This made me realise that even simple browser elements like hyperlinks, error messages, filters, and layout behaviours can be used creatively. I looked at early net art for inspiration. Works by Olia Lialina helped me understand the beauty of handmade HTML pages. JODI’s glitch-style websites showed me how something broken can still be expressive. I also thought a lot about link rot and how the internet is full of pages that disappear while their assets remain.

These influences shaped both the visual decisions and the structure of the project. I tried to balance intentional decay with readability, which was sometimes difficult but rewarding.

3. How the Site Works

The whole project uses only HTML and CSS, following the requirements of the assignment. I stayed close to the workshop examples, keeping the same page flow with a header, small navigation bar and a main content area. I used flexbox for the layout of the cards and the gallery. Background layering and semi-transparent overlays helped me control contrast and make the skull background more subtle. CSS transitions and simple keyframe animations were used to create slight movements so the pages felt alive for a moment before sinking back into stillness.

Filters such as grayscale, contrast and opacity adjustments were used to give images a decayed or faded look. I also used the translateX trick to center the skull element in the memories page. I tried to comment the code clearly so another student would understand what I was doing.

4. Process and Challenges

The biggest challenge was keeping the pages readable while still achieving a decayed feeling. Dark themes can easily hide the text if the colours are not balanced. Positioning the cards over the skull image also took time, because I didn’t want the background to take over. Another challenge was spacing and composition. Slight offsets made the cards feel more like memories pinned on a board, but too much staggering made them messy. I had to adjust it until the balance felt right.

Working with only HTML and CSS also meant being creative with small techniques instead of relying on more advanced tools. This limitation actually helped me understand CSS more deeply and pay attention to details like shadows, spacing, opacity and subtle movements.

5. How I Would Extend the Project

If I had more time, I would continue exploring decay within the limits of HTML and CSS. I would experiment with slower, more atmospheric transitions to make the pages feel like they are ageing while the user is still looking at them. I would also work on scroll-based fading effects, or layouts that distort slightly depending on how long a page has been open.

Another extension would be adding sound, like quiet static or low-quality ambient noise, because sound carries a strong feeling of memory and loss. I would also expand the graveyard with more digital leftovers such as old banner graphics, fragments of early web interfaces or icons from websites that no longer exist.

Even without adding new programming languages, there is a lot that can be done by adjusting visuals, timing, layering and texture.

6. Asset Information

I created or edited the skull image myself based on a reference from typcarroll.com. All text, descriptions and layout decisions were written by me. All HTML and CSS code was also written by me, using workshop structures as a guide.

Found materials that appear in the project include the glitch GIF from giphy.com, the classic 404 face, the corroded motherboard reference image and the Digi-Decay typeface posters. I added their sources directly above the relevant image elements inside the HTML files so that everything is clearly credited.

7. Final Reflection

This project helped me understand digital decay not just as something disappearing, but as something transforming. The internet does not forget cleanly. Instead, it leaves fragments behind. I tried to capture that in the way each page behaves, and in the mood created by the dark backgrounds, faded colours and small animations.

While working on this project, I realised how expressive simple HTML and CSS can be. The browser became more than a display; it started to feel like a space for memory, loss and atmosphere. I now see how these small technical elements can communicate emotion and how digital culture is shaped by what remains, not only by what is new.
