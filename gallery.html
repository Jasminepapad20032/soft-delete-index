          <figcaption>
            the classic error face. technically this page “does not exist”,
            but the file still sits on some forgotten server. <br>
            hover to watch the layout twitch like it is trying to remember
            where it used to belong.

          <figcaption>
            is this what you picture when you hear <em>digital decay</em>?<br>
            metal rusting, green dust, dying chips.<br>
            this is hardware rot: the body of the machine failing,
            while the data on it pretends to be immortal.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>




        <!-- fragment 3: Syntax error -->

            alt="pixelated font spelling: Syntax failed, Reboot required">

          
          <figcaption>
            computers crash in sentences, not in screams.
            <br> <span class="highlight">syntax failed, reboot required</span>
            feels like a polite obituary for code that will never run again.
          </figcaption>

        <!-- fragment 4: digi decay artefact -->

        <!-- Same source as previous typeface:

          <figcaption>
            letters melting into pixels, like they were printed on
            wet paper and then scanned badly.
            <br>this is typography pretending to be corrupted data:
            a costume version of decay.
          </figcaption>

        <!-- fragment 5: text only -->

        <figure class="fragment text-only">
          <div class="window-title">why_a_graveyard.html</div>


          <figcaption>
            not everything here is “important”. some files were always trivial:
            banners, loading wheels, stock error pages.
            <br><br>
            but they still quietly survived their context.
            the websites closed, the forums broke, the blogs were wiped,
            and these tiny assets kept looping in folders nobody checks.
            <br><br>
            this graveyard is a soft delete: a place to look at leftovers of
            the web and admit that deletion is rarely clean. the browser keeps
            seeing ghosts long after we click “close tab”.
